# 387Z-program-database

This is the official database for 387Z's code, there are going to be 2 main files you'll want to focus on, the framework, and the current version code.

The "Framework" will have the needed files for actually running the program, it'll come in a .zip file, all you need to do once you've downloaded it is, right click it, click extract all, a new window will pop up, click extract at the bottom right, then it's extracted, another new window should appear after the extraction is complete, open up the file and you should see "jared.v5code" load that file in VEXv5Text, this is where the code from current version code will go.

Now for the "Current Version Code". You'll find this and with it you should see older versions, unless we need those, just ignore them, for current version you'll see a large block of code, copy and paste this into vexcode (there should be a few names on the left side of your screen, one of which is main.cpp, you want to paste the code here)

If you have any more questions, just @ me on discord (soon to be ms teams)!
